            <p>My name is Christopher Sympson. I often go by Chris, but in many situations there are multiple Chris's so I'll go by Topher. This past year I got married to my beautiful wife, Ysabel and am eager to see where our future takes us!</p>
            <br>
            <p>I am currently attending the University of Richmond to complete an intensive Code Camp! Since my days in High School (Back in the early 2000s!) I always thought it would be cool to become a developer. As time went on I started getting more and more interested in Web Development. I tried many times to learn on my own but always hit a wall when things began to get difficult. For this reason I started to research different in-class offerings to become a web developer. Now I'm here and super excited to see what I will become capable of! The sky's the limit!</p>
            <br>
            <p>Through this course I hope to learn a ton, practice practice practice and start a new career! I would love to eventually be able to work from home and know this is a great profession to be in for that kind of flexibility! Either being employed full-time with some company or even starting my own, being a web developer gives a great flexibility of remote work!</p>
